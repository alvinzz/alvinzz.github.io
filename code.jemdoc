== Code Libraries

=== [https://github.com/alvinzz/named_tensors Named Tensors]
PyTorch Library - Supports named dimensions for multidimensional arrays. Reduces code ambiguity; enables better debugging and
run-time checks. Provides more functionality than PyTorchâ€™s native implementation.

=== [https://github.com/alvinzz/safe_transforms Type-Safe Coordinate Transforms]
Rust Crate - Implements type-safety for transforms between coordinate systems: projecting a point in coordinate frame A
into camera B will raise a compile-time error.
